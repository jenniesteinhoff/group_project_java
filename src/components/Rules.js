        <p>In Minesweeper, your mission is to navigate a grid filled with hidden mine and uncover all the safe blocks without detonating the bomb.
   As you click on individual blocks, you'll reveal what is underneath the block.  
  If you click on a block containing a mine, it'll explode, ending your game. 
   To win, successfully reveal all the safe blocks without triggering any explosion.</p>
   <p>Happy Playing!</p>
